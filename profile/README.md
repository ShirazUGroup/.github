# This Is Distributed Software Laboratory

## Research Focus

- **Federated Learning**, This research area focuses on developing machine learning models that can be trained collaboratively across multiple devices or servers while keeping data decentralized. Federated learning enables privacy-preserving model training.
- **Distributed Machine Learning**, The lab likely explores distributed algorithms and techniques for training large-scale machine learning models. These methods distribute computation across multiple nodes to handle massive datasets efficiently.
- **Cloud Computing**, Research in this area involves studying cloud infrastructure, services, and resource management. Cloud computing enables scalable and on-demand access to computing resources.
- **Serverless Computing**, The lab may investigate serverless architectures, where developers can build applications without managing servers explicitly. Serverless platforms automatically scale and allocate resources as needed.

## GitHub Repository

The lab maintains a public GitHub repository where they share code, projects, and research findings related to the above technologies.

## Location

The lab is situated at Shiraz University.
